## üîß Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have these installed:
- **C++17** or later
- **CMake** 3.8 or newer

### Quick Start

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This repository uses Git submodules. When cloning, make sure to use the `--recursive` flag:


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasJowett/AttercopEngine.git --recursive
   cd Attercop
   ```

   If you have already cloned without --recursive, you can initialize the submodules afterward by running:

   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
    ```

### Running the App
After a successful build, run the executable from the build directory:
```
./App/App
```
